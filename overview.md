# Pipeline Manager

## Overview

**Pipeline Manager** extension allows users to view pipelines arranged in your custom folders and search for them by name, folder name (path), state (Enabled, Paused or Disabled), repository or tags.

## Features
* Easy to use 
* Shows last build's badge
* Re-run the build on main branch (the name of the main branch depends on the repository's settings)
* Pipeline status is visible from the list. No need to do multiple clicks to go to the build's Edit view to see whether the pipeline is disabled or not.
